# Hacktoberfest: unoptimized fibonacci!

This repository is for encouraging unexperienced people to contribute to the open-source society. The function fibonacci() (in the fibonacci_original.py file) is deliberately implemented in an unoptimized way. You can reimplement the function using a better approach in a seperate file (don't edit fibonacci_original.py so that others still have the original implementation as a starting point.) and submit a pull request!
